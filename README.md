### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator function.

It is a function that prompts the user to input student marks.

The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        1. **A - > 79**
        2. **B - 60 to 79**

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector function.

 It is a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. 
 If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. 
 Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

*Example*
    If the speed is 80, it should print: **“Points: 2”**. 
    If the driver gets more than 12 points, the  function should print: **“License suspended”**.
